Metamorphic Testing for assessing hydrological models.

This repository contains the code for the paper ["Reliability Assessment of Machine Learning Models in Hydrological Predictions through Metamorphic Testing"](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029471). More figures on the predictions for changing input can be found in https://github.com/stsfk/HydroMT/tree/main/paper_figures.


Corrections to the published paper:

1. In Section 2.1.2 line #4, an "f" is missing before "(xn)" in the equation.
2. In the bottom right of Figure 1, the axis labels should be swapped.
3. In the box that connects to "Inconclusive test" in Figure 2, the starting index of y should be "k+1".
4. In Section 3.1 line #2, the label "Figure 2" should be corrected to "Figure 4".
