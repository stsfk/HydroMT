Metamorphic Testing for assessing hydrological models.

This repository contains the code for the paper ["Reliability Assessment of Machine Learning Models in Hydrological Predictions through Metamorphic Testing"](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029471). More figures on the predictions for changing input can be found in https://github.com/stsfk/HydroMT/tree/main/paper_figures.
